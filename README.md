# cs121-cordova

This is a repository for two assignments I had for my Android app development course. Both of these projects are based on Cordova. Each branch contains a different project.

### hw5

This is an implementation of the [15 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). This is slightly interesting because not all random arrangements of the 15 puzzle are solvable, which I had to account for in the two randomization functions I made. One animates the board scrambling for the user, and the other just does it instantly (as the rubric requested).

### hw6

This is an implementation of Battleship. The two players play on separate phones and communicate with a server to play against each other.
